kly they had responded in the past, and that they could form this expectation after just a few
interactions. The time that users reported expecting an email response ranged from fifteen minutes
to a few days. This varied depending on the urgency of the message, the correspondents involved, and
the work culture. Expectations for quick responses (under an hour) reflected a high level of
knowledge about the recipient’s availability and behavior. In cases where little context about the
recipient was known, the expectation was usually one day (mentioned by 16 out of 24 Phase II
subjects). … I would typically think it should be 24 hours. Even if they don’t have the answer they
should at least say, ‘I got your email, it will require a little bit of research, and I’ll get back
to you by whenever.’

For example, Patty, a solutions manager, will frequently scan the last week’s worth of email in her
inbox to assess whether or not she’s maintained her responsiveness image on a per-person basis: I

hink I should know, I should keep checking. Many of our interviewees (11 out of 13 at Sun) claimed
to use a simple responsiveness-maintenance technique: If they are unable to respond in a
“reasonable” amount of time (usually about 24 hours), they send a message saying they need more
time. In this way, they are able to preserve a responsive image. I usually will get back to email or
people the same day, … even if it’s just to say ‘I need to look into that and I’ll get back to you
as soon as I can.’ Because I kind of think it’s rude if you ask someone for information and they
just totally ignore you. It’s one thing if they need time

responds within a day. It’s something I want to keep open, and so I may, on purpose, spread out my
responses a little bit, so that she doesn’t think it’s a chore to respond to me, and then we can
have more of an interaction, actually, than we’ve been able to have in the past. People attempt to
project an image in order to counteract assumptions that people might otherwise make about
responsiveness. For example, Cindy, an engineer who works at home twice a week explained: I think I
check mail more often when I’m at home. Because I feel I’m out of the group, say if they suddenly

study was the type of responses given when a responder exceeded the average expected response time
for email. When a person responded 2-2 ½ weeks after the original email, some responses included an
apology and explanation (Kalman, et. al, 2006). However, there were instances during this time
period when a person responded with a follow-up email in reference to the subject matter and not an
answer to previous inquiry from the original email request. Furthermore, once a person’s response
time exceeded a month,

based on historical rhythms could also be modified by other inputs tracked by a dynamically updated
awareness service. Just as current IM systems detect when users are logged on and how recently they
have been active on their computer keyboard, this information could be tracked over time and used to
develop a sense of how much opportunity a user has had to access and thus respond to email. That is,
if an email recipient has been away from his keyboard more than usual, it might lengthen the time
before a response should be expected without triggering an indication that a breakdown has occurred.
Another factor that could be tracked is the recipient’s current backlog of email. If an email
recipient currently has a larger than usual number of unread messages in her inbox, she may not be

your message but just need some time to think about it. Since users invest substantial effort to
maintain a certain responsiveness image, they were frustrated to learn that their image could be
undermined by features in their email client such as read-receipts. The default settings for
Microsoft Outlook among the users we interviewed were that receivers were unaware that they were
generating a read-receipt when they read e-mail messages. Thus, they did not realize that the
senders could have more revealing information about when they read the messages than they were
trying to project. This lack of control of what information others have of your activities can
