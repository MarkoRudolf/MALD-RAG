email, it will require a little bit of research, and I’ll get back to you by whenever.’ From our
interviews, we identified seven main observations of email usage that we will discuss in this paper.
We found that users: • display typical patterns of response behaviors • maintain a responsiveness
image • take advantage of contextual cues to explain responsiveness • use email with other media •

ted in time by about seven hours or more. Such email will probably be read and acted upon while the
sender is offline. Most of the work-related email that our subjects talked about occurred within a
peri-synchronous context. There was enough time overlap that correspondents could expect a response
within a day, and would even afford iterations and discussion throughout the day. In this sense, any
individual message could leave room for discussion or be incomplete, but the thread could resolve to

ce technique: If they are unable to respond in a “reasonable” amount of time (usually about 24
hours), they send a message saying they need more time. In this way, they are able to preserve a
responsive image. I usually will get back to email or people the same day, … even if it’s just to
say ‘I need to look into that and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.’ Because I kind of think

e had a clear sense of when to expect email responses from people based on how quickly they had
responded in the past, and that they could form this expectation after just a few interactions. The
time that users reported expecting an email response ranged from fifteen minutes to a few days. This
varied depending on the urgency of the message, the correspondents involved, and the work culture.
Expectations for quick responses (under an hour) reflected a high level of knowledge about the

Just as current IM systems detect when users are logged on and how recently they have been active on
their computer keyboard, this information could be tracked over time and used to develop a sense of
how much opportunity a user has had to access and thus respond to email. That is, if an email
recipient has been away from his keyboard more than usual, it might lengthen the time before a
response should be expected without triggering an indication that a breakdown has occurred. Another

common response was one day (8 out of 24), followed by two days and one week . The other 7
respondents did not use an auto-reply mechanism. One interesting use of the auto-reply feature was
described by Ellen, a supply buyer. She typically takes a day to catch up on email after returning
from an extended trip. During this time, she may be less responsive to new incoming mail. Her

original email, some responses included an apology and explanation (Kalman, et. al, 2006). However,
there were instances during this time period when a person responded with a follow-up email in
reference to the subject matter and not an answer to previous inquiry from the original email
