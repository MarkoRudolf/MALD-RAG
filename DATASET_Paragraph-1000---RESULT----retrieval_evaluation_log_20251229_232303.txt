our subjects talked about occurred within a peri-synchronous context. There was enough time overlap
that correspondents could expect a response within a day, and would even afford iterations and
discussion throughout the day. In this sense, any individual message could leave room for discussion
or be incomplete, but the thread could resolve to a conclusion within a day. However, email
correspondents with international colleagues who were time shifted by seven hours or more exhibited
a different pattern. Since they could not expect a response within a day, people talked about
thinking more carefully about those messages and taking the time to be more clear, explicit, and

ded to email more slowly than expected: … this week she happens to be in class. So she'll check her
email on a break. My manager … he’s very busy, at meetings all day. I’m guessing, doesn't respond as
quickly as I wish because, they’re so busy they can’t get to their email. I think it depends upon
what he is doing when he gets the email. Comments in the interviews helped identify what contextual
cues were being used to help interpret email responsiveness. Many of these observations suggest ways
it might be helpful to convey these cues through email or by integrating with other tools.

Contextual Cues From Within Email Besides tracking people's historical response rates, other
contextual cues for response rate were conveyed through email itself. An important resource is the
use of “auto-reply” or “vacation” messages. This feature creates an automatic response to any email
received with a message that usually explains that the user is absent and sets an expectation of
when they will be able to respond to the message. The value of these messages is described by an
administrative assistant who complained about people who failed to use them: You ask someone for
information that they know, and you sit around waiting and waiting for them to get back to you, and
you find out that they’ve been out of town. In Phase II, we asked the subjects “How long of a work
absence is required to cause you to use an auto-reply message?” The most common response was one day
(8 out of 24), followed by two days and one week . The other 7 respondents did not use an auto-reply
mechanism. One i

to find out the answer, but it’s nice to hear that, that they’re in the office, that they received
your message but just need some time to think about it. Since users invest substantial effort to
maintain a certain responsiveness image, they were frustrated to learn that their image could be
undermined by features in their email client such as read-receipts. The default settings for
Microsoft Outlook among the users we interviewed were that receivers were unaware that they were
generating a read-receipt when they read e-mail messages. Thus, they did not realize that the
senders could have more revealing information about when they read the messages than they were
trying to project. This lack of control of what information others have of your activities can
frustrate the maintenance of a responsiveness image and create privacy concerns. We later learned of
a related example (outside of our formal interviews) of a user who timed her email sending activity
to manage when people could lear

ew days. This varied depending on the urgency of the message, the correspondents involved, and the
work culture. Expectations for quick responses (under an hour) reflected a high level of knowledge
about the recipient’s availability and behavior. In cases where little context about the recipient
was known, the expectation was usually one day (mentioned by 16 out of 24 Phase II subjects). … I
would typically think it should be 24 hours. Even if they don’t have the answer they should at least
say, ‘I got your email, it will require a little bit of research, and I’ll get back to you by
whenever.’ From our interviews, we identified seven main observations of email usage that we will
discuss in this paper. We found that users: • display typical patterns of response behaviors •
maintain a responsiveness image • take advantage of contextual cues to explain responsiveness • use
email with other media • use email peri-synchronously when quick replies are expected • reciprocate

Outside Email Besides cues from email itself, users cited a number of contextual cues from other
sources that often helped explain delays in email response. Shared online calendars have been shown
to be a valuable resource for coordinating group work (Palen, 1999), and several users mentioned
them as a way of explaining email delays. Browsing someone else's calendar is one way of discovering
that they are on vacation (especially if they do not use auto-reply vacation messages). At Sun, 9 of
the 13 subjects described relationships and situations in which they expected a response within an
hour, and sometimes within 15-20 minutes. Failure to receive a response within that time would
prompt them to check the calendar of the correspondent. If her calendar showed that she had a
meeting scheduled at that time, it would often explain the delay in responding, and suggest when she
would return and have a chance to respond to the message. Others mentioned that the knowledge of
their corresponde

nteresting use of the auto-reply feature was described by Ellen, a supply buyer. She typically takes
a day to catch up on email after returning from an extended trip. During this time, she may be less
responsive to new incoming mail. Her solution is to leave the “Out-of-office” auto-reply feature
activated during this day after she returns (even though she is in her office), conveying to senders
that they should not expect her typical responsiveness. We later learned of an example (outside of
our interview study) of another user, Sam, who always leaves an auto-reply message on. The message
explains that email is an unreliable way to reach him and his ability to respond to email is
erratic, and directs people to contact him over the phone. While auto-reply messages give an
explicit explanation of why an email response might be delayed, these messages are only sent in
response to receiving a message from someone. Thus, the sender would not know in advance about the
delayed response, and

Response Behaviors Most of our subjects (21 out of 24 in Phase II) check their email “constantly”—
they have an email client open all day long (when at their computers), and are notified immediately
of new email. One exception we found was Karen, an engineer who works from home, who turned off
automatic fetching of new mail in her client: … because it’s too distracting… So I said, ‘OK, forget
it,’ when I decide that I want to read email, I’ll check it. Some of the subjects who check email
from home work in “offline” mode, where they explicitly download new email, rather than being
automatically notified. This behavior is often the result of a technical limitation of not having an
always-on Internet connection at home. But we also found that some people prefer to avoid the
“distraction” of email when working outside the office: - I’m always on when I’m here… Constantly.
Except when I’m at home… I’m in an offline mode… I’m going to deal with email very differently… - I
